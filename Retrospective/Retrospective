TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team ##13)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done 7/3
- Total points committed vs. done 20/11
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team) 69/72

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |         |       |            |              |
|  HT-1   |    2     |      3  |    7        |        16   |
|  HT-3  |    2     |      3  |    5      |        5  |
|  HT-4   |    3    |      5  |    10    |        8  |

   

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
  - Hours per task estimated: 22/11= 2h
  - Hours per task actual: 29/11 = 2,63h
  - Standard Deviation estimated: 2,05
  - Standard Deviation actual: 4,64

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1
  - 22/29 - 1 = 0.75 - 1 = -0.24
  
  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

Underestimastion of the total work load. Too many tasks spread among teammates.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

We should split in small teams, instead of working individually, on less stories. 

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

More balance between stories size (smaller and divided in more tasks) and team management. More people may deal with the same story and eventually to the same tasks so that they can work together.

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

Fast response when help or information are needed and good quality work.
